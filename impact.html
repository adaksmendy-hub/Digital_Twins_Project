            <h3>Biomedical engineering</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Personalised Medicine and Treatment Optimization:</b> Digital Twins hold potential for patient-specific modeling, intergrating genomic
             , protemic, and other multi-omics data to enable tailored health interventions. For example facilitate the creation of individualized treatments
            such as determining optimal chemotherapy dosing based on patient's specific tumour dymanics.</li>
                <li><b>Bioprinting and Testing Engineering:</b>DTs are revolutionizing Bioprinting and testingby creating high-fidelity virtual
                replicas of both resulting biocontrusts. in <b>bioprinting</b>Dts use real time data data from sensors and predictive models to allow 
                for virtual prototyping, optimize parameters like nozzle speed and enable real-time automatic process control saving time and resources.
                They also facilitate essential in silico testing of the bioprinted tissue to accurately predict its functionality and long-term viability</li>
                <li><b>Surgical and Device Simulation:</b>In surgical planning and medical device design, digital twins simulate procedures and test devices
                before real world implementation .for instance, digital replicas of organs generated from imaging data, allow surgeons to rehearse complex
                procedures virtually reducing operative risks.</li>         
            </ul>

        <section class="content-block">
        <h3>Manufacture and Industry</h3>
        <p>Digital twins are used to create virtual replica of entire factory floors or assemble systems.
            this helps in optimizing robot movements, testing changes to the layout, and ensuring maximum throughout
        before and physical changes are made.</p>

            <h3>Smart cities</h3>
            <p>Most modern cities use Digital Twins to model traffic flow, energy consumption, and public services.
                This enables city planners to test new infrastructure projects, manage resources effectively, and respond 
                faster to emergencies.
