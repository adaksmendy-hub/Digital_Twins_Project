            <h2>What is a Digital Twin?</h2>
            <p>A digital twin is a virtual representation of a real-world object
                or system (like an engine, a product,or human organ) that continuously receives real-time data to mirror the behavior of the object or 
                system.
                Its <b>a living data-driven simulation</b> that evolves as its real counterpart changes.its not just a 3D model.
                The concept for digital twins traces its origins to NASA's early efforts in creating physical replicas for space mission simulation
                in the 1960's. The Digital Twin paradigm formally emerged in the 2000's as data collection, storage and computational modelling matured,
                allowing for virtual rather than physical.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Context and Evolution</h3>
            <p>This has been reliant on several converging technologies</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h2>The Development of the IoT</h2>
                <p>This was a crucial shift as the IoT devices provided the framework of connected devices and sensors necessary to gather 
                        and transmit real-time data from physicalobjects
                </p></li>
                <li><h2>Technology Advancements</h2>
                <p>Advancements in computing power, cloud storage and sophisticated software algorithms created the infrastructure needed to process
                    the vast amounts of data cllected by IoT Devices
                </p></li>
            </ul>
                <p>twins have evolved beyond single objects. They can now represent an entire system, processes and even organisations allowing
                for more analysis and managnment. While initially focused on manufacturing,The applicaton of digital twins has extented into areas such as 
                construction, urban planning and healthcare.
